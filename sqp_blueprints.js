// Official CBSE paper patterns, held in the repository rather than scraped.
//
// CBSE publishes a pattern about once a year, so fetching it from
// cbseacademic.nic.in on every prompt generation was slow, fragile and pointless.
// This file is the source of truth instead: it ships with the app, so it works
// offline, survives every redeploy, and never depends on the CBSE site or on a
// paid host with a persistent disk.
//
// HOW TO ADD OR UPDATE A SUBJECT
//   Key   : "<Class> || <Subject>" exactly as they appear in the dropdowns.
//   year  : the session the pattern was taken from.
//   text  : the paper's General Instructions, as the AI should follow them.
// A subject with no entry here is not a problem: the app already computes a full
// section-by-section blueprint for every class, subject and exam, and that is
// what drives the paper. An entry here is supporting detail, so only add one for
// a pattern that has actually been checked against the published sample paper.

// The Accountancy paper's structure, written down once. Both the pattern text
// below and the paper-design instructions in main.js are generated from these
// numbers, so a correction lands everywhere at once. Getting this wrong in one
// copy and not the other is exactly how the prompt came to claim both 7 and 12

             Assertion-Reason based questions, of 1 mark each (20 x 1 = 20).
  Section B: Questions 21 to 25 are Very Short Answer (VSA) questions of 2 marks each (5 x 2 = 10).
  Section C: Questions 26 to 31 are Short Answer (SA) questions of 3 marks each (6 x 3 = 18).
  Section D: Questions 32 to 35 are Long Answer (LA) questions of 5 marks each (4 x 5 = 20).
  Section E: Questions 36 to 38 are case study based questions of 4 marks each (3 x 4 = 12),
             each with three sub-parts (i), (ii), (iii) of 1, 1 and 2 marks.
There is no overall choice. Internal choice is provided in 2 questions of Section B,
2 questions of Section C and 2 questions of Section D, and in the 2-mark sub-part of
every Section E question.
Draw neat and clean figures wherever required. Take pi = 22/7 wherever required, if not stated.
